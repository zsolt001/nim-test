# Welcome to Synthesis tutorial.
# This will go over the functionalities of Synthesis with
# an executable example.
#
# Important: ensure you use the exact same case for your states
#            SOlid and Solid, will be considered different.
#
# First of all, declare the States of your state machine and the
# events it will react to.

type
  Phase = enum
    ## States of your automaton.
    ## The terminal state does not need to be defined
    Solid
    Liquid
    Gas
    Plasma # Plasma is almost unused

type
  Event = enum
    ## Named events. They will be associated with a boolean expression.
    Over100
    Between0and100
    Below0
    OutOfWater

# Reminder: use the exact same case for your states and events

# Common configuration
# -------------------------------------------
# Then declare your automaton
# And setup its entry and exit.

# Create a "waterMachine" entry.
declareAutomaton(waterMachine, Phase, Event)

# Optionally setup the "prologue". Extra state goes there, the variables are visible by all.
setPrologue(waterMachine):
  echo "Welcome to the Steamy machine version 2000!\n"
  var temp: float64
  var inputTemps: seq[float64]
  inputTemps = tempFeed

# Mandatory initial state. This must be one of the valid state of the "Phase" enum.
setInitialState(waterMachine, Liquid)

# Terminal state is mandatory. It's a pseudo state and does not have to be part of the state enum.
setTerminalState(waterMachine, Exit)

# Optionally setup the "epilogue". Cleaning up what was setup in the prologue goes there.
setEpilogue(waterMachine):
  echo "Now I need some coffee."

# Events
# -------------------------------------------
# Events are named boolean expressions that will be reused
# to trigger state transitions.
#
# Events have visibility over the following variables:
# - The parameters of the synthesized state machine in our case it is `tempFeed`
#   ```
#   synthesize(waterMachine):
#     proc observeWater(tempFeed: var seq[float])
#   ```
# - The variables created in `setPrologue`
# - The variables created in `onEntry`. Keep in mind
#   that `onEntry` in state-specific and that
#   exceptional `interrupt` event do not trigger `onEntry`
#
# Event checks are directly inlined in the state machine.

implEvent(waterMachine, OutOfWater):
  inputTemps.len == 0

implEvent(waterMachine, Between0and100):
  0 < temp and temp < 100

implEvent(waterMachine, Below0):
  temp < 0

implEvent(waterMachine, Over100):
  100 < temp

# Reminder: use the exact same case for your states and events

# `onEntry` and `onExit` hooks
# -------------------------------------------
#
# `onEntry` and `onExit` are state-specific processing
# introduced:
# - before checking if an event happened for `onEntry`
# - after the transition function and before changing state for `onExit`
#
# They can accept an array of states
#
# `onEntry` and `onExit` have visibility over the following variables:
# - parameters of the synthesized automaton
# - variables created in `setPrologue`
#
# `onEntry` can defined state-local variables that will be visible for
# events or transitioons.
#
# `onEntry` and `onExit` are bypassed in case of an `interrupt` behaviour
#
# `onEntry` and `onExit` are directly inlined in the state machine.

onEntry(waterMachine, [Solid, Liquid, Gas]):
  let oldTemp = temp
  temp = inputTemps.pop()
  echo "Temperature: ", temp

# `behaviors`
# -------------------------------------------
#
# Behaviours describe the transitions between state in a declarative way.
#
# They all must have a `transition` section. Normal Nim code can be used
# there: function calls, if/then/else, even nested proc declarations.
# Use `discard` if there is no transition function to apply.
#
# Transitions are directly inlined in the state machine
#
# - `ini` takes an initial state or an array of those
# - `fin` takes a final state switched to after the transition is applied
# - `steady` is used for states that do not change unless an event is triggered.
#   This is equivalent to a ``while true`` loop.
# Either ini+fin or steady are required.
#
# Ini+fin behaviours can be conditional on an named `event`
# that should be implemented with `implEvent`.
# `implEvent` does not have to be called before the behavior,
# any order is acceptable.
#
# For special cases, you can use `interrupt` instead of `event` to
# model situations that require specific handling.
# `interrupt` are bypass `onEntry` and `onExit` hooks.
#
# Interrupts purpose is handling termination or broken assumptions like
# a container or a message queue being empty while onEntry and normal
# behaviours may assume that it is not empty in general.
#
# In case of conflicting conditions:
#
# - Interrupt behaviors are always resolved before normal event-based behaviour.
# - In the same class, behaviors are checked in their order of declaration.
#   If there is potential conflict, it is recommended to declare all behaviors
#   pertaining to a state in a single file to not depend on the order of imports.
# - Default behaviour (with no event, including steady) have no conditions and are
#   applied last.

# Termination condition. `Exit` was declared in setTerminalState.

# `Synthesize`
# -------------------------------------------
#
# Synthesizing the automaton will transform the previous specification
# into a concrete procedure with a name, type and inputs of your choosing.
#
# Assertions are inserted to ensure the automaton
# stops if a state+event combination was not handled.
#
# You can pass "-d:debugSynthesis" to view the state machine generated
# at compile-time.
#
# The generated code can also be copy-pasted for debugging or for extension.
